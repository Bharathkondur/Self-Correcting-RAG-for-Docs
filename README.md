## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates an **enterprise-level Self-Correcting RAG system** that goes beyond basic RAG implementations. The system features an automated evaluation loop that grades its own answers for hallucinations and relevance. When answer quality is low, it automatically rewrites the query and retries—mimicking how a human researcher would refine their approach.

### 🔥 Key Features

- **🔄 Self-Correction Algorithm**: Powered by LangGraph for sophisticated control flow (Retrieve → Grade → Generate → Grade → Rewrite → Retry)
- **📊 Quality Assurance**: Integrated evaluation system to assess hallucination and answer relevance
- **⚡ Real-time Processing**: Fast PDF ingestion and intelligent document chunking
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Clean, responsive web interface with real-time feedback
- **🔧 Enterprise Ready**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **🤖 Multi-LLM Support**: Works with OpenAI GPT models and local Ollama models
- **📄 PDF Intelligence**: Advanced PDF processing with semantic chunking

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- **FastAPI** - High-performance async API framework
- **LangChain & LangGraph** - LLM orchestration and workflow management
- **FAISS** - Vector similarity search
- **PyPDF** - PDF processing and text extraction

**Frontend:**
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Lightweight, no-framework approach
- **Modern CSS** - Responsive design with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Font Awesome** - Professional iconography

**AI/ML:**
- **OpenAI GPT** - Primary LLM for reasoning and generation
- **Ollama** - Local LLM fallback option
- **Embeddings** - OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 or local models

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (recommended) or Ollama installed locally
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-correcting-rag.git
   cd self-correcting-rag
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in backend directory
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
   
   *Alternatively, for local-only setup, install Ollama and pull required models:*
   ```bash
   # Install Ollama first, then:
   ollama pull mistral
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Upload a PDF document
   - Start asking questions!

## 💡 How It Works

### The Self-Correction Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Question] --> B[Retrieve Documents]
    B --> C[Grade Relevance]
    C --> D{Relevant?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Generate Answer]
    D -->|No| F[Rewrite Query]
    F --> B
    E --> G[Grade Answer]
    G --> H{Quality OK?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Return Answer]
    H -->|No| J{Max Retries?}
    J -->|No| F
    J -->|Yes| K[Return Best Attempt]
```

### Core Components

1. **Document Ingestion**: PDF files are processed, chunked semantically, and embedded into a FAISS vector store
2. **Retrieval**: Relevant document chunks are retrieved based on similarity to the user's question
3. **Grading**: Retrieved documents are evaluated for relevance using an LLM-based grader
4. **Generation**: Answers are generated using the relevant context
5. **Self-Evaluation**: Generated answers are graded for quality and factual accuracy
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Poor answers trigger query rewriting and re-processing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration (Recommended)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Custom model settings
MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo
TEMPERATURE=0.5
MAX_TOKENS=1000
```

### Local LLM Setup (Ollama)

If you prefer to run everything locally:

```bash
# Install Ollama
# Download from https://ollama.ai/

# Pull required models
ollama pull mistral          # Main reasoning model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text # Embedding model
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the included test suite:

```bash
cd backend
python test_api.py
```

Test with sample documents:

```bash
# Generate a test PDF
python make_pdf.py

# Or use your own PDF files
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile example
